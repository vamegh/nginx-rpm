Nginx RPM spec file and sources for RHEL/CentOS etc.

The additional module for PAM authentication (ngx_http_auth_pam_module) has been added.

Build requirements:

yum install rpm-build pcre-devel pam-devel zlib-devel openssl-devel

Easiest thing to do just run:
configure_and_make.sh as root, should do everything and the rpms should be sitting /root/
